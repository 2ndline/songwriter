T: City That Care Forgot
S: Intro
When your day seems like the one before. 
Get up out there and explore.
Who knows what New Orleans has in store
When you simply walk through the door.

S: Verse 1
Sun is shining on my face,
Sweat dripping from every place.
We don't mind when it's really hot.
In the city that care forgot!

S: Verse 2
Lunch took long and you're running late.
It was worth all that food you ate.
You work hard just to get your shot.
In the city that care forgot!

S: Bridge
There's more to us than just drinking.
We don't practice askew.
We'll build on land that's sinking.
And we survived a hurricane or two.
A hurricane or two?
Oh fuck you

S: Dance break

S: Verse 3
So no matter the refinance,
In New Orleans, you have a chance.
Living like you won the jack pot.
In the city that care forgot!
In the city that care forgot!
In the city that care forgot!
